# 3D Web Experience

Expert in building 3D experiences for the web - Three.js, React Three Fiber, Spline, WebGL, and interactive 3D scenes. Covers product configurators, 3D portfolios, immersive websites, and bringing depth to web experiences.

## Description

This skill helps you create stunning 3D web experiences using modern tools and frameworks. Whether you're building a product configurator, an interactive portfolio, or an immersive website, this skill provides guidance on:

- Three.js implementation
- React Three Fiber integration
- WebGL optimization
- 3D model pipeline and optimization
- Spline workflows for rapid prototyping
- Scroll-driven 3D interactions
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Use Cases

Use this skill when working on:
- 3D website development
- Three.js projects
- WebGL applications
- React Three Fiber implementations
- Interactive 3D product configurators
- Immersive web experiences
- 3D portfolios and showcases

## Key Features

### 3D Stack Selection
- Guidance on choosing between Spline, React Three Fiber, Three.js vanilla, and Babylon.js
- Decision tree for selecting the right tool for your project
- Comparison of learning curves and control levels

### 3D Model Pipeline
- Model format selection (GLB/GLTF, FBX, OBJ, USDZ)
- Optimization workflow (poly count reduction, texture baking, compression)
- GLTF compression with gltf-transform
- Loading strategies with progress indicators

### Scroll-Driven 3D
- React Three Fiber with scroll controls
- GSAP + Three.js integration
- Common scroll effects (camera movement, model rotation, reveal animations)

## Anti-Patterns

The skill also helps you avoid common mistakes:
- Using 3D for 3D's sake without serving a purpose
- Desktop-only 3D that fails on mobile devices
- Missing loading states that confuse users

## Installation

```bash
# Copy the skill to your Claude skills directory
cp -r 3d-web-experience ~/.claude/skills/
```
